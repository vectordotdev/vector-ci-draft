### Breaking changes

#### Removal of various deprecated internal metrics {#deprecated-internal-metrics}

Over the course of many of the previous releases, we've been working to deprecate the usage of older
internal metrics as we worked towards implementing full support for the [Component
Specification][component_spec], which dictates the basic metrics that all components, or the basic
metrics all components of a specific type, are expected to emit.

We've made enough progress on this work that we've gone ahead and removed many of the deprecated
metrics from this release. First, below is a list of all metrics we've removed:

- `events_in_total` (superceded by `component_received_events_total`)
- `events_out_total` (superceded by `component_sent_events_total`)
- `processed_bytes_total` (superceded by either `component_received_bytes_total` or
  `component_sent_bytes_total`, more below)
- `processed_events_total` (superceded by either `component_received_events_total` or
  `component_sent_events_total`, more below)
- `processing_errors_total` (superceded by `component_errors_total`)
- `events_failed_total` (superceded by `component_errors_total`)

Most of the removals have straightforward replacements, but the `processed_`-prefixed metrics
involve a small amount of logic. For **sources**, `processed_bytes_total` is superceded by
`component_received_bytes_total`, and `processed_events_total` is superceded by
`component_received_events_total`. For **sinks**, `processed_bytes_total` is superceded by
`component_sent_bytes_total`, and `processed_events_total` is superceded by
`component_sent_events_total`.

A small note is that a small number of components still emit some of these metrics, as they provided
additional tags and information that is disallowed by the Component Specification. They will be
removed in a future version once we can rectify those discrepancies, but they are effectively
removed as of this release: you cannot depend on them still existing.
