Vector's 0.31.0 release includes **breaking changes**:

We cover them below to help you upgrade quickly:

## Upgrade guide

### Breaking changes

#### `component_received_event_bytes_total` and `component_sent_event_bytes_total` consistently use estimated JSON size of the event {#event_json_size}

Prior to this Version, metrics emitted by Vector were inconsistently measuring
the byte size of the events that were being sent and received. These metrics
have been updated for all components so they always emit an estimate of the size
of the event should it be serialized to JSON.

Measuring the events like this allows a consistent measurement to be applied
across all components regardless of how the source or sink serializes the event
when connecting to the external service.
